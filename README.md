# finding-and-modeling-polariton-interactions-from-noisy-data

In this work, we **measured and validated the presence of polaritons entangled with high-energy photons**. This study addresses fundamental aspects of quantum optics and signal extraction in noisy environments.

## Experimental Data Acquisition

The experimental setup utilized a $2\text{D}$ detector (camera) to capture the photon events:

* **Detector Output:** Raw data is composed of a large number of **$512\text{x}512$ pixel images**.
* **Scanning Procedure:** For each specific **photon energy ($\text{E}$)**, we performed an **angular scan** of the photon beam, resulting in a unique image for every angle ($\theta$).

This multi-dimensional data structure is conceptually depicted below:

## Signal Extraction Methodology

To extract the angular curve (the core quantum signature) for each energy, we implemented a robust signal processing protocol (details in `yyy`):

1.  **Region Definition:** In each image, we define two critical rectangular regions:
    * **Signal Region:** A rectangle assigned around the **focus spot** (see red rectangle in Fig. 2).
    * **Background Region:** A fixed rectangle assigned around a quiet point in the **background** (see green rectangle in Fig. 2).

2.  **Curve Generation:** The red and green curves shown in Fig. 2 are generated by **summing the pixel intensity** contained within their respective regions across all measured angles.

3.  **Noise Subtraction:** The raw Signal Region (red curve) is inherently contaminated, consisting of two distinct features: **our quantum feature and a noise feature**.
    * We **normalize the Background curve** to match the magnitude of the noise component within the Signal curve.
    * By **subtracting the normalized Background curve** from the Signal curve, the pure **quantum signal is extracted**.

## Theoretical Validation

A comprehensive **theoretical simulation and framework based on Quantum Electrodynamics ($\text{QED}$)** was developed concurrently to **validate and explain the experimental results**. (See `xxx` for the theoretical documentation and code).
