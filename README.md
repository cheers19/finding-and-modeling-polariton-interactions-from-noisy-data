# finding-and-modeling-polariton-interactions-from-noisy-data

In this work, I **measured and validated the presence of polaritons entangled with photons**. 

## Experimental Data Acquisition

The experimental setup utilized a $2\text{D}$ detector (camera) to capture the photon events:

* **Detector Output:** Raw data is composed of a large number of **$512\text{x}512$ pixel images**.
* **Scanning Procedure:** For each specific **photon energy ($\text{E}$)**, I performed an **angular scan** of the photon beam, resulting in a unique image for every angle ($\theta$).

This multi-dimensional data structure is conceptually depicted in Fig. 1:

## Signal Extraction Methodology

To extract the angular curve (the core quantum signature) for each energy, I implemented the following signal processing protocol (see `Data Analysis Demo`):

1.  **Region Definition:** In each image, we define two critical rectangular regions:
    * **Signal Region:** A rectangle assigned around the **focus spot** (see red rectangle in Fig. 2).
    * **Background Region:** A fixed rectangle assigned around some fixed point in the **background** (see green rectangle in Fig. 2).

2.  **Curve Generation:** The red and green curves shown in Fig. 2 are generated by **summing the pixel intensity** contained within their respective regions across all measured angles.

3.  **Noise Subtraction:** The raw Signal Region (red curve) is inherently contaminated, consisting of two distinct features: **our quantum feature** and **a noise feature**.
    * We **normalize the Background curve** to match the magnitude of the noise component within the Signal curve.
    * By **subtracting the normalized Background curve** from the Signal curve, the pure **quantum signal is extracted**.

## Theoretical Validation

A theoretical simulation was then developed to validate and explain the results (**See `Theoretical Analysis` for the theoretical documentation and code**).
